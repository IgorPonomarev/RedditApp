# RedditApp

This app is a realisation of [CodingWithMitch course](https://github.com/mitchtabian/Reddit-RSS-App) with some adjustments:

1. `ListView` and `CustomListAdapter` in MainActivity updated to `RecyclerView` and `PostAdapter`

1. `ListView` and `CommentsListAdapter` in CommentsActivity updated to `RecyclerView` and `CommentAdapter`

1. All the `RelativeLayouts` switched to `ConstraintLayouts`

1. The app shows **"funny"** subreddit instead of empty screen and error on app launch

1. Added a **login icon** instead of text button in options menu

1. Other minor design improvments
